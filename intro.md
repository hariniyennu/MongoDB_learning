# What is MongoDB and Why Use It?
- **MongoDB** is a NoSQL database designed for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Unlike SQL databases that store data in tables with rows and columns, MongoDB stores data in **JSON-like documents.**
- It is schema-less, which means the structure of the data can change over time, allowing for greater flexibility.
- It is highly scalable and supports horizontal scaling, making it a great choice for applications that expect to grow over time.
